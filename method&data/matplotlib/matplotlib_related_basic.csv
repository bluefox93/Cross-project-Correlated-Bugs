I'm just starting to use the new code now.\r\n\r\nI found that some of the changes break things in the SuperDARN Data Plotting Notebook (https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy/blob/35c3de481ff4a12699401b390d7d4e387592ead9/docs/notebook/SuperDARN%20Data%20Plotting.ipynb). I tried fixing some of these problems myself last night, but ran into some issues I want to get feedback on before changing anything.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the figure keyword was removed from plotting.rti.plot_rti() (https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy/blob/35c3de481ff4a12699401b390d7d4e387592ead9/davitpy/pydarn/plotting/rti.py#L87). It looks like this was done because the new code loops through a frequency band filter and is then supposed to return a list of figures.\r\n- I personally advocate against this, as I think these plotting routines should just return a single object. That sort of looping should be done in a user-level script or a wrapper.\r\n- If we do want to keep this functionality, then there are some issues in plot_rti() we need to fix.\r\n\r\nNext, the overlay of potential contours is now broken. I think this is because of bug in matplotlib.ticker.LinearLocator(), and filed and issue regarding that here: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6270\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNathaniel"""

I don't really know the details but I assume that IPython is somehow providing its own backend. Inspecting a figure object created with backend 'tk' or 'wx' I notice that `show()` doesn't seem to be a bound method but a function, pointing at the respective backend's implementation of `show()`?\r\n\r\nIt seems like figure objects should provide this in the context of notebook inline plotting, even if it's a no-op, for the sake of not breaking existing code."""
